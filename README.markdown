# Play OpenTTD in you GitHub Readme!

There's quite some hype for setting up your own unique GitHub readme these days.

In the earlier days of computing, people were excited about the advancements to computer graphics and they were more than eager to show them off by adding flashing animations, 3D effects, bevels, skeuomorphism, and colourful gradients to everything they touch. As users got accustomed to these effects, we started to cut away these unnecessary visual fluffs and focused on what really mattered - the content.

When developers realised that they could make their profile page animated, it feels like we couldn't resist going back to our old mindset and show off how unique their profile page could be. In fact, people started adding animations, adding badges that automatically update, and even tabletop games! Sure, why not. Let's have some fun with our readme's too before it gets old (if it ever gets old).

*How far can we go?*

*How about adding a 3D real-time multiplayer game to your readme, like, I don't know, OpenTTD?*
